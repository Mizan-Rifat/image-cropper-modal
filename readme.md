This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for the tutorial on [Creating an Image Upload Modal with Crop and Rotate Functionality in React](https://dev.to/mizanrifat/creating-an-image-upload-modal-with-crop-and-rotate-functionality-in-react-5cbd). The tutorial explores how to build a user-friendly image editing feature similar to popular platforms like GitHub or Facebook.

By leveraging the [react-easy-crop](https://github.com/ValentinH/react-easy-crop) library and React's context API, we minimize prop passing between components, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the [blog post](https://dev.to/mizanrifat/creating-an-image-upload-modal-with-crop-and-rotate-functionality-in-react-5cbd) to build your own image modal and enhance your React applications with intuitive image editing capabilities.

Check out the [live demo](https://mizan-rifat.github.io/image-cropper-modal) to see the image modal in action!
